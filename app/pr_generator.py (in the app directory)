def generate_pr():
    # Your code to generate a PR goes here.
    pass

# ... Other PR generation logic ...
```

These changes will help fix the issue by creating a new `README.md` file in the root directory, modifying the test file `test_pr_generator.py`, and adding a new function `generate_pr()` in the `app/pr_generator.py` file.

Please note that these changes are specific to this auto-generated PR and may vary depending on the actual repository structure and requirements.
