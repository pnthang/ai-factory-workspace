```python
import pytest
from content import write_to_hello_txt,  # Replace with your function that writes to a file named "hello.txt"

```python
def test_write_result():
    assert write_to_hello_txt == True
```

```python
# Assuming you have the following in your `content.py` module:

```python
import pytest
from content import write_to_hello_txt,  # Replace with your function

def test_write_to_hello_txt():
    result = write_to_hello_txt(    "Hello.txt")  # assuming it's a simple text file to test.

    assert result == True

# Jest integration example (run the tests)

```python
pytest.main([__file__])
```

In this script, I've created a function that reads the 'hello.txt' file and asserts that the write_to_hello_txt() function returns `True`. This is used by pytest to run the tests.

Please make sure your code is set up correctly and test cases are as expected.
